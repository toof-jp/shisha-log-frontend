- **State Management**: React Context for authentication

## Features

### Authentication System
- User registration with user_id, password, and display name
- Login/logout functionality
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password change functionality
- Password reset flow
- Automatic profile creation upon registration

### Profile Management

  - Personal notes
  - Order details
- View all user sessions with pagination
- View detailed session information

- Loading states and error handling
- Clean and intuitive navigation

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the Shisha Log Backend API (localhost:8080/api/v1) with the following endpoints:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/change-password` - Change password
- `POST /auth/request-password-reset` - Request password reset
- `POST /auth/reset-password` - Reset password with token

### Profile Endpoints (Protected)
- `GET /profile` - Get user profile
- `POST /profile` - Create user profile (auto-created on registration)
- `PUT /profile` - Update user profile

### Session Endpoints (Protected)
- `GET /sessions` - Get user sessions with pagination
- `GET /sessions/:id` - Get specific session
- `POST /sessions` - Create new session
- `PUT /sessions/:id` - Update session
- `DELETE /sessions/:id` - Delete session

## Data Models

### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  display_name: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### Profile
```typescript
interface Profile {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  display_name: string;
  bio?: string;
  avatar_url?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### Session
```typescript
interface Session {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  created_by: string;
  session_date: string;
  store_name: string;
  mix_name: string;
  flavors: Flavor[];
  notes?: string;
  order_details?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### Flavor
```typescript
interface Flavor {
  id: string;
  session_id: string;
  flavor_name: string;
  brand: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

## Validation Requirements

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number

### User ID Requirements
- Minimum 3 characters
- Maximum 30 characters
- Must be unique

## Security Features

- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token attachment to API requests
- Token expiration handling with redirect to login
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Input validation and sanitization

## Environment Configuration

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API base URL (defaults to http://localhost:8080/api/v1)

## Development Workflow

1. User registers account → Profile automatically created
2. User logs in → Receives JWT token
3. User can create, view, edit, and delete shisha sessions
4. User can manage their profile information
5. All data is persisted via backend API

## Error Handling

- Network errors with user-friendly messages
- Form validation with field-specific errors
- Authentication errors with automatic logout
- Loading states during API operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
